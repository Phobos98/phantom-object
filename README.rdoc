= A Hash to object converter

Allows you to convert complex Hashes into objects for more common use.

In your Gemfile, make sure you have this gem:

  gem 'phantom-object'

Now you can do this

  h = {
    key: "Some value",
    another_key: "Another value"
  }

  o = PhantomObject.new(h)

  p h.key
  # => "Some value"
  p h.another_key
  # => "Some value"

And even this

  h = {
    nested: {
      key: "Some value"
    }
  }

  o = PhantomObject.new(h)

  p h.nested.key
  # => "Some value"

For any level, and with arrays

And also you can do this, instead of PhantomObject.new()

  h = {
    key: "Some value",
    another_key: "Another value"
  }

  o = h.to_object

  p h.key
  # => "Some value"
  p h.another_key
  # => "Some value"

Also, PhantomObject includes ActiveModel, and you can extend it to use validations, form builders, etc.
